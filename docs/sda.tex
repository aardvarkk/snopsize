{\bf BETWEEN}:\hspace{0.2in}\={\bf Eoin Corrigan} (the "Customer") \\
{\bf AND}:\> {\bf Tau Labs } (the "Developer") 
\end{tabbing}
The Customer and Developer agree as follows:
\section{Purpose of Agreement}
Customer desires to retain Developer as an independent contractor to develop the computer software (the "Software") described in the Functional Specifications (the "Specifications") (see section \ref{sec:functional_spec}) of this Agreement. Developer is ready, willing, and able to undertake the development of the Software and agrees to do so under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
\section{Functional Specification}
\label{sec:functional_spec}
The full functionality of the Software is defined in the following web page descriptions.
\subsection{Home Page}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{home_page.png}
\caption{Home Page}
\label{fig:fig_home_page}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The Home Page is the page a user will first encounter upon visiting snopsize.com. A list of "top" snops will appear on this page. These will be the most recent snops, snops that have been saved frequently (popular snops), or a combination of both.

Links will be available within each snop to navigate to all of the snops from the author of the given snop, and to all snops related to the same original URL.

A user will have the ability to search for snops from this page. For more detail on search functionality, please reference section \ref{sec:search_results_page}. 

If a user is not logged in, they will have the option to log in (assuming he or she has an existing snopsize.com account), or sign up for the service if they don't have an account. If the user has forgotten their password they will have the ability to request an email with their password.

If the user is already logged in they will have the ability to log out, as well as access their User Page. 

General site navigation will be available at the bottom of the page and will be common to all pages on snopsize.com.
\subsection{Sign Up Page}
This is a page that is shown to a new user who wishes to sign up. It should be directly accessible from most areas of the site. Many features of the site will operate properly without a user being signed up. However, saving snops from other users and creating new snops will both require a user account. A single user name should be linked to a specific email address. No more than one user name should be allowable per email address. Sign up should also require a certain password strengths. Forgotten passwords and login credentials may be overcome with password reset emails to reset the login credentials.
\subsection{Snop View}
Snops must be viewable in multiple ways. A Search Result containing snops can't display them in their entirety. As such, snops will need a short summary view which contains an overview or snapshot of the snop content. A full snop view is also necessary for a user to see the entirety of the snop at once. This view will be used on the User Page and the Related Page to show the snop contents. 

Both the full snop view and the line item snop view should have user and URL based links. From a snop, a user should be able to quickly navigate to Related snops or to other snops written by the same user. The full snop view should also have the ability to be saved to a user's snops if the snop was not written by that user. This feature may also be possible directly from the line item view. It is presumed that at full size, only one snop is likely to be able to be shown at any given time on a given device.
\subsubsection{Snop Structure}
\label{sec:snop_structure}
A snop will consist of the following fields:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User (Mandatory)
\item Title (Mandatory)
\item Source URL (Optional)
\item Point 1 (Optional)
\item Point 2 (Optional)
\item Point 3 (Optional)
\item Summary (Optional)
\end{enumerate}
Any fields marked as optional may be left empty during the creation of a new snop. The snop structure consists of 3 main points, this forms an "essay" style structure where you have a title, 3 points, followed by a summary.
\subsection{Search Results Page}
\label{sec:search_results_page}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{search_results.png}
\caption{Search Results Page}
\label{fig:fig_search_results_page}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The Search Page allows users to search for snops. A search will simultaneously examine three distinct areas: users, URLs, and keywords.

A search term may be seeking a particular user name. In such a case, the search results should contain user names similar to the search query. The site user would then be able to follow a link to the User Page.

A search term may be seeking snops related to a particular URL. If a direct match is made on the URL, the search result will take you directly to the Related Page for that URL. If no direct match is found, the site user will be told that the URL is not found and will be given an option to create the first snop for that particular URL.

Finally, a search term may be seeking snops related to a given keyword. In such a case, the search results should contain snops containing instances of those keywords. The snops would show up in a summary view so that the site user can quickly look through them.

A search result will contain two possible links to pursue the given snop. One link will be related to the user name of the creator of the snop. Following that link will lead to a display of all of that user's snops, with the linked snop shown full size. The site user may then choose to navigate to other snops created by the same user. Alternatively, the site user may follow a link related to the URL of the snop. Note that this will only be possible if the original snop contained a URL. Following such a link, the site user will be presented with a list of snops related to the same URL as the given snop. This dual-view approach to browsing snops will be common to other areas of the site.

The intention will be to simplify the Search function by not requiring a user to enter a search type (user, keyword, or URL). We may, however, find that we require a search type to narrow down search results.
\subsection{Related Page}
The Related Page contains listings of snops that all reference the same URL. All of the snops should be directly related in that they are speaking about the same original article or page. URLs must match exactly to be linked in the Related Page. It will be possible to create a snop regarding the particular URL from this page. 
\subsection{User Page}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{user_page.png}
\caption{User Page}
\label{fig:fig_user_page}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The User Page contains listings of snops that were created by a single user. The listing will also contain snops favourited by the given user. The two types will be differentiated. 

All snops generated by a user will be made public. Snops will be uneditable once created, however they may be deleted. Inability to edit means that a user will never be surprised when a snop they favourited changes. Ability to delete allows users who do not wish to share information to remove it. Any existing links to that snop will still function, but produce a message that the given snop has been removed. 

If the user is on their own user page, they will also be able to create a new snop.
\subsection{Snop Creation Page}
The act of creating a snop will require its own interface. Users may enter information in any of the snop fields. The user can indicate completion through a "Snop" button. Only some snop fields will be considered mandatory (see section \ref{sec:snop_structure}). A snop should have a title and a user name. The user name will be guaranteed to be valid, since only users who have signed up for the service will be able to create snops. 

Initially, the snop boxes will all be shown but are blank. The user may move through the boxes in any order to complete the desired information before completing the snop. The snop creation process may be cancelled at any point during the creation. 

Behaviour upon completion of the snop should be context-sensitive. If the user initially created the snop from a Related Page, the user should be returned to that page and have their snop displayed. Likewise, if the user created the snop from their own User Page, they should be returned to that page and have their snop displayed.
\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Languages and Internationalization}
American English will be the only supported language in which to view the site. Snops themselves may be written in any language, but the site itself will not be translated into multiple languages.
\subsection{Software Requirements}
The web service will run correctly on the three top platforms (PC, Mac, and Linux). Across platforms, support is planned for the following browsers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chrome
\item Firefox
\item Internet Explorer
\item Safari
\end{enumerate}
Although every effort will be made to support legacy browsers, identical appearance and performance cannot be guaranteed in outdated versions of the browsers named above.
\subsection{Visual Design}
Visual design of the web application will be outsourced to a third party. The costs incurred as a result of visual design will be the responsibility of the Developer.
\subsection{Web Hosting}
The Customer will be responsible for hosting the web application and paying any related costs to web hosting. Depending on the technology chosen to develop the web application, the Developer may request the Customer to change their hosting provider. This will ensure that the web application can be run properly. Any costs for switching the hosting arrangements will be handled by the Customer.
\section{Delivery}
\subsection{Deliverables}
\subsection{Schedule}
\section{Payment}	
\subsection{Budget}
Assuming \$80,000 per annum and 253 work days, that’s \$316 / working day
At a \$15,000 budget, that means approximately 48 working days
With two people, that means 24 working days or \~{}25 working days = 5 weeks
Given the whole \$15,000 budget, we should only work approximately 5 weeks as a pair to make sure we’re earning the equivalent of around \$80,000 per annum
\subsection{Schedule}
Should we separate into code releases and ask for portions of the total budget to be released to match? Or just say “we’ll do all of this and then you pay us everything at the end”?
- Normally I would say lets do a payment schedule (divide it up into pieces), but for this one we might have to do everything at the end so it gives us time to incorporate and get a bank account and everything?
\section{Payment of Developer’s Costs}
Customer shall reimburse Developer for the cost of any development software or commercial software libraries the developer deems necessary to complete this project, subject to approval by Customer.
\section{Changes in Specifications}
Customer may, in its sole discretion, request that changes be made to the Specifications, or other aspects of the Agreement and tasks associated with this Agreement. If Customer requests such a change, Developer will use its best efforts to implement the requested change at no additional expense to Customer and without delaying delivery of the Software. In the event that the proposed change will, in the reasonable opinion of the Developer, require a delay in the delivery of the Software or would result in additional expense to Customer, then Customer and Developer shall confer and Customer shall, in its discretion, elect either to withdraw its proposed change or require Developer to deliver the Software with the proposed change and subject to the delay and/or additional expense.
\section{Acceptance Testing of Software}
Customer shall have 15 days from the date of delivery of the Software in final form to inspect, test and evaluate it to determine whether the Software satisfies the functionality set forth in the Specifications.

If the Software does not satisfy the functionality, Customer shall give Developer written notice stating why the Software is unacceptable. Developer shall have 15 days from the receipt of such notice to correct the deficiencies. Customer shall then have 15 days to inspect, test and evaluate the Software. If the Software still does not satisfy the functionality set forth, Customer shall have the option of either (1) repeating the procedure set forth above, or (2) terminating this Agreement pursuant to the section of this Agreement entitled "Termination." If Customer does not give written notice to Developer withing the initial 15-day inspection, testing and evaluation period or any extension of that period, that the Software does not satisfy the functionality, Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Software upon expiration of such period.
\section{Ownership of Software}
Developer assigns to Customer its entire right, title and interest in anything created or developed by Developer for Customer under this Agreement ("Work Product") including all patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. This assignment is conditioned upon full payment of the compensation due Developer under this Agreement. 

Customer assigns the Developer rights to make mentions of the Work Product for the purposes of marketing the Customer as the original developer of the Work Product. This includes, but is not limited to, images of the Work Product, screen shots, other media, etc.
\section{Ownership of Background Technology}
Customer acknowledges that Developer owns or holds a license to use and sublicense various pre-existing development tools, routines, subroutines and other programs, data and materials that Developer may include in the Software developed under this Agreement. This material shall be referred to as "Background Technology."  

Developer retains all right, title and interest, including all copyright, patent rights and trade secret rights in the Background Technology. Subject to full payment of the consulting fees due under this Agreement, Developer grants Customer a nonexclusive, perpetual worldwide license to use the Background Technology in the Software developed for and delivered to Customer under this Agreement, and all updates and revisions thereto. However, Customer shall make no other commercial use of the Background Technology without Developer’s written consent.
\section{Warranty}
